## How to Use

1. **Choose a prompt** that matches your task
2. **Copy the entire prompt** content
3. **Paste it into your AI assistant** conversation (Claude, GPT, etc.)
4. **Provide context** about your codebase
5. **Let the AI guide you** through the process

### Example Usage

[Paste the Clean Code Refactoring prompt]

Now analyze this codebase and help me refactor it:
[Your code or repository context]
```

### Why These Prompts Matter in the AI Age

In the era of AI code generation, these prompts are **MORE relevant than ever**:

- **Better AI Prompting**: Use these as frameworks to get better output from AI coding assistants
- **Code Review**: AI generates code fast - you still need to review it for quality, security, and performance
- **Architecture Decisions**: AI can write code, but you still need to make architectural choices
- **Team Standards**: Establish consistent patterns that both humans and AI should follow
- **Learning**: Understanding these principles helps you write better prompts and evaluate AI-generated code

**The shift**: From "writing all code yourself" → "reviewing, guiding, and architecting with AI assistance"
