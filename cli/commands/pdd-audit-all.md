# Full Operations Audit

> **DEPRECATED**: This command is deprecated. Use `/pdd-audit all` instead.
> This command will be removed in v3.0.

**Usage:** `/pdd-audit-all`

Run all three audits in sequence: DevOps, Security, and Production Readiness. Generates a comprehensive combined report.

---

## Workflow

This command orchestrates the execution of:
1. `/pdd-audit-devops` - Infrastructure and deployment analysis
2. `/pdd-audit-security` - Security vulnerability assessment
3. `/pdd-audit-production` - Production readiness check

### Phase 1: DevOps Audit

Execute full DevOps audit:

**Scope:**
- Dockerfile analysis
- CI/CD configuration review
- Kubernetes/IaC inspection
- Firebase workflow check
- Deployment status review

**Output:** DevOps findings with severity ratings

---

### Phase 2: Security Audit

Execute full Security audit:

**Scope:**
- Dependency vulnerability scan
- Secrets detection
- Token path analysis
- Injection vulnerability scan
- Authentication audit
- DDoS vulnerability assessment
- Data leakage analysis

**Output:** Security findings with severity ratings

---

### Phase 3: Production Readiness Audit

Execute full Production Readiness audit:

**Scope:**
- PRD feature completion check
- Test coverage analysis
- DevOps status (summary)
- Security status (summary)
- Backend staging logs analysis
- Frontend staging logs analysis
- Performance check

**Output:** Go/No-Go recommendation

---

### Phase 4: Generate Combined Report

Create unified audit report:

```markdown
# Full Operations Audit Report

**Date:** [TODAY'S DATE]
**PRD:** [Current PRD if applicable]
**Overall Result:** ✅ READY / ❌ NOT READY / ⚠️ CONDITIONAL

| PROD-003 | Frontend memory leak | src/components/Dashboard |
| PROD-004 | 3 TODOs blocking | Various |
| PROD-005 | PRD-002 80% complete | - |

---

## All Advisories (Nice to Fix)

### DevOps
| ID | Issue | Location |
|----|-------|----------|
| DEVOPS-003 | No Docker caching | Dockerfile |
| DEVOPS-004 | Missing .dockerignore | - |
| DEVOPS-005 | Manual rollback | - |

### Security

## Go/No-Go Recommendation

### ❌ NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**Reason:** 2 security blockers must be fixed before deployment.

### Required Actions Before Deploy:
1. [ ] Fix CVE in axios (upgrade to 1.6.0+)
2. [ ] Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints

### Recommended Actions (can deploy with warnings):
3. [ ] Increase test coverage to 80%
4. [ ] Add Kubernetes readiness probe
5. [ ] Move tokens to httpOnly cookies
6. [ ] Fix frontend memory leak

### Post-Deploy Actions:
7. [ ] Address all advisories
8. [ ] Complete PRD-002 remaining 20%
9. [ ] Add HSTS headers

## Timeline Estimate

| Priority | Items | Effort |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Blocker fixes | 2 | 2-4 hours |
| Warning fixes | 11 | 2-3 days |
| Advisory fixes | 6 | 1-2 days |

2. "Also save individual audit reports?"
3. "Create a PRD for all fixes?"

- Provide clear go/no-go decision
- List all blockers prominently
- Generate actionable fix list

**MUST NOT**:

**SHOULD**:
- Deduplicate findings across audits
- Prioritize combined recommendations
- Estimate fix effort
- Suggest timeline for remediation
