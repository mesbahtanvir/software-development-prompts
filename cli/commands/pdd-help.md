## Quick Start

1. **Initialize PDD in your project:**
   ```
   /pdd-init
   ```

2. **Create your first PRD:**
   ```
   /pdd-prd-create feature
   ```

3. **List PRD status:**
   ```
   /pdd-prd-list
   ```

4. **Find gaps (outputs a PRD for each):**
   ```
   /pdd-find-unimplemented 001
   /pdd-find-bugs
   ```

## The PDD Cycle

```
Write PRD → Implement → Find Gaps → (gaps become new PRDs)
```

**Core Principle:** No PRD, No Code.
